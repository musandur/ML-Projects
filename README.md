# ML-Projects
The purpose of this readme documentation is to guide any visitor through the different **Deep Learning**  tasks that I have so far implemented and upload here.
Broadly speaking, all the uploaded works address image-based prediction tasks by using **neural networks, convolutional neural networks and some computer vision frameworks.**


In the folowing, I will provide a quick describtion of each uploaded file and give a *url link* that, once clicked on, will directly lead to the content of the very work! Note also that I these mini-projects were implemented on Google Colab notebook. I also used the integrated GPU in this notebook. It was free until at some point when I had to buy my own GPU pro.


# Image Segmentation and detection
First of all, to perform image segmentato√≠on and image/object detection, I have chosen to work with synthetic data. That is, I have create my own dataset that I have generated from some mathematical models that I built in the past during some of academic research project. That is indeed very interesting, as it will exposed me to work on a dataset that is very different from the usual ones. Besides, I just felt like my academic research was helpful in the sense that I could use a part of it to perform some AI tasks.

# Image object detection
In this work, I have use the MASK-RCNN framework to perform object detection in a custom dataset. Given the nature of my dataset, I have drawn a link to some biological application including single/multiple cell splitting scenarios. The link to the mini-project is [here](https://github.com/musandur/ML-Projects/blob/main/Object_Detection.ipynb)
