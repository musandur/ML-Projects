# ML-Projects
The purpose of this readme documentation is to guide any visitor through the different **Deep Learning**  tasks that I have implemented and upload here.
Broadly speaking, all the uploaded works address image-based prediction tasks by using **neural networks, convolutional neural networks and some computer vision frameworks.**


In the folowing, I will provide a quick describtion of each uploaded file and give a *url link* that, once clicked on, will directly lead to the content of the very work!


# Image Segmentation and detection
First of all, to perform image segmentato√≠on and image/object detection, I have chosen to work with synthetic data. That is, I have create my own dataset that I have generated from some mathematical models that I built in past during my some of academic research project. That is indeed very interesting, as it will expose one to some dataset that are different from the usual ones.
